(2) HIGHER UV INTENSITY THAN 100 LED. Delivered by massive TRIPLE 1.2A UV LEDs. (3) UNBEATABLE UV RANGE. Now the UV beam throw goes out to more than 70 feet. This is BIG LEAGUE",
      "YOU\u2019LL MAKE BIG COST SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN. uvBeast V3 does a re-configured power delivery system. Way more efficient than common 100 LED versions. A costly but necessary evil for that tech",
      "EVEN HIGHER UV INTENSITY THAN 100 LED VERSIONS. Flick the switch on the V3 and you\u2019ll see the difference of the upgraded 3x SMD LEDs.

V3 now uses SMD tech to pump higher intensity UV delivered at 3.6 Amps (3x1.2A LEDs) \u2013 just when you thought that our 100 LED couldn\u2019t get any more intense!",
