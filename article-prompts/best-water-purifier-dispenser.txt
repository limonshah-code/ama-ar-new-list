      "6-STAGE ADVANCED FILTRATION WITH UV LIGHT: The Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV boasts a superior 6-stage filtration system, featuring a 0.0001\u03bcm RO membrane, including UV light and an added remineralization filter. Certified by WQA against NSF/ANSI/CAN 372 for lead-free and tested by SGS, this combination effectively reduces TDS, PFOA, PFOS, Chlorine, Fluoride, Arsenic, Lead, and more, while also enriching water with essential minerals, balancing taste and health benefits.",
      "COUNTERTOP FILTRATION + PREMIUM-QUALITY CARAFE: No plumbing or installation is required for this RO system. Simply plug this portable piece of tech into any power source and you're ready to fill it up and go! Better yet, the water container is constructed of a high borosilicate glass carafe instead of the traditional plastic, reducing the risk of secondary pollution and making this one of the best countertop water filter systems.",
      "POWER SAVING + WATER SAVING: The water system automatically enters power-saving standby mode when not in use to reduce power consumption. Filters are also designed to help save water with an impressive 2:1 Pure to Drain ratio. Leftover water from a cycle isn't deemed wastewater so more water is saved to use for various household purposes.",
      "FILTER LIFE MONITOR: The countertop water filters last for a long time between 12-24 months to provide 1-2 years of clean drinking water before needing replacement. Monitor display shows the service life of filters and water quality so you can easily keep track of filter replacement and periodically switch out filter tubes.",
      "SUSTAINABLE HYDRATION: 1-year limited manufacturer warranty included upon registration. Designed with premium quality components for years of reliable use, our RO system delivers bottled-quality water at home, reducing plastic waste and supporting sustainability efforts with ClimatePartner Certification."
