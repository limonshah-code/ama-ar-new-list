Use Beef, Fish, Pork, Lamb, or Poultry presets or set a custom target. Monitor temps, track remaining cook time, and control cooking via the Typhur app for stress-free results",
      "360\u00b0 Turbo Convection System: Air fry wings, fries, or veggies with minimal oil for a golden, crispy exterior while keeping the inside tender and juicy. Dual heating elements and a 2400 RPM fan circulate heat in a full 360\u00b0 for faster, more even cooking, roasting dishes up to 30% quicker than traditional ovens. Perfect for healthier, chef-quality results",
      "12-in-1 Cooking Versatility: With a wide temperature range of 85\u2013450\u2109 and 3 fan speeds, the oven offers 12 cooking modes (Roast, Bake, Air Fry, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Toast, Bagel, Proof, Reheat, Dehydrate, Keep Warm) and 5 probe presets (Beef, Fish, Pork, Lamb, Poultry).

      "Note: For proper ventilation, allow at least 4\u2033 (10\u202fcm) of clearance around the oven. A countertop depth of at least 16.4\u2033 is recommended, including this clearance. When using the roast pan on the lowest rack at 450\u00b0F, the temperature may exceed this due to the heating element. For safety, we recommend using heat-resistant silicone gloves instead of fabric mitts"
