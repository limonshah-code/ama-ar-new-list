      "\u3010Using Notes\u3011\uff1a Since the humidity sensor is located above the air inlet of the product, the wind speed is high when the machine is running, and more humid air is extracted here. The humidity here will be higher than the humidity of the use environment. When the environment real humidity is 3% lower than the setted humidity, the compressor will automatically shut down, and the fan will continue until the environment real humidity is 3% higher than the setted humidity, and the compressor will work again."
