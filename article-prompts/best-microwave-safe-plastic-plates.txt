      "[ Upscale & Stylish Wheat Straw Dishes Set for 8 ] - We know it\u2019s hard to believe, but this dinnerware set IS NOT ceramic. Our products are made using a blend of wheat straw and non toxic, food safe polypropylene, which binds the natural materials together and makes them unbreakable and microwavable. Included are (8) 10.5\" dinner plates, (8) 7.5\" dessert plates, and (8) 27 oz cereal bowls. Pairs perfectly with our Grow Forward cups sets!",
      "[ Natural Wheat Straw Dinnerware ] - With a high-end look unmatched in the wheat straw space, our custom designed plastic dinnerware sets beautifully complement your existing flatware and glassware. These modern wheat straw plates and bowls sets are easy-to-clean reusable plastic dishes sets for the kitchen. Dishwasher safe, perfect as camping dinnerware, suitable year-round, stackable and space-saving. Great as both indoor and outdoor dishes.",
      "[ Lightweight & Unbreakable Dinnerware] - Sturdy and lightweight, these non breakable plastic plates and bowls sets for 8 are shatterproof and anti-chip. The durable, drop-friendly design adds an extra layer of safety for the whole family. Perfect as poolside outdoor plates and wheat straw dinnerware sets for the patio. Our bowls and plates combine the nice look of classy dinnerware with the practicality of wheat straw materials.",
      "[ Dishwasher Safe & Microwave Safe ] - Fridge and freezer safe too! Please note that because our dishes contain natural materials, pressure from sharp knives may leave scratches, and microwaving red sauces for too long can cause staining (this is the nature of all wheat straw dinnerware). However, they will not break or chip like porcelain or ceramic and won't splinter like wood, making them a great option for everyday use.",
      "[ Earth Conscious & Planet Friendly ] - At Grow Forward, we make sure our eco-friendly products are always good for the Earth. Wheat straw dishes have a smaller carbon footprint than reusable plastic plates and consume less energy than other materials without harming forests or altering natural ecosystems. Thank you for supporting an American small business."
