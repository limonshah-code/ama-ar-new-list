      "Reduces Drying Times: The Tjernlund M-4DBT is designed specifically to reduce drying times by enhancing the exhaust airflow of your dryer. If your home has a dryer duct that runs longer than 25 feet or has multiple bends, you may experience sluggish drying due to weak exhaust performance. The M-4DBT\u2019s 200 CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) fan boosts the airflow, enabling duct runs up to 100 feet in length.",
      "Automatic Activation: The M-4DBT offers hassle-free operation thanks to its automatic activation feature. The fan turns on and off in sync with your dryer based on pressure, requiring no manual intervention. In addition, it includes a post-purge setting, which keeps the fan running for a few minutes after the dryer cycle finishes. This ensures that any residual lint is completely cleared from the ductwork, preparing the system for the next load.",
      "Works with All Clothes Dryer Brands: The Tjernlund M-4DBT is universally compatible, meaning it works with any residential clothes dryer brand. There's no need for complicated wiring or integration with the dryer itself. The universal switch activates the fan automatically as soon as your dryer starts, making it incredibly easy to install and use. The M-4DBT will fit seamlessly into your laundry setup, improving its performance instantly.",
      "Energy Efficiency and Safety: The M-4DBT doesn\u2019t just save you time\u2014it also helps you save on energy costs. Shorter drying times mean your dryer runs for less time, reducing energy consumption and lowering your utility bills. Additionally, by promoting better airflow through your duct system, the M-4DBT helps prevent lint buildup, one of the leading causes of dryer-related fires.",
      "Industry-Leading Design: Tjernlund Products, a 5th generation manufacturer with decades of experience, has engineered the M-4DBT to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. Built to last, this dryer booster fan is crafted from durable materials and designed with precision to withstand the demands of constant use."
