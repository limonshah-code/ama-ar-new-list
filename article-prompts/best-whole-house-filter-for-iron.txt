      "Easy Installation and Filter Change The system comes pre-assembled onto the mounting bracket for a streamlined, DIY installation. Filter wrench included to make routine filter changes easy and quick. Refer to our manual and our helpful YouTube videos to install this point-of-entry (POE) filtration system at the main water supply to get clean and healthy water for the entire family. With 1 NPT inlet/outlet and 10 x 4.5 filter cartridges, the system has a minimum impact on water flow (up to 15 GPM) and requires minimum maintenance.",
      "Top-Notch Quality The first stage CTO Carbon Block filter is made of high-quality coconut shell carbon for maximum filtration efficiency and filter life. It is tested by an independent third-party to meet NSF/ANSI standards. The iron and manganese reducing filter lasts up to 3 times longer than greensand due to the catalytic media not being consumed in the process. Those filters have a filtration capacity of up to 50,000 gallons of water, enough to supply a family of four with clean water for up to a year.",
      "Please Note This system is installed at the main water supply line in order to treat all the water in your home. For well/pond water with very high iron/manganese please contact us for customized solutions. Unlike an RO system, this system will NOT reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and instead keeps healthy minerals in your water. If you are interested in a filter that removes TDS, please consider our iSpring Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems RCC7 series or tankless RO500."
