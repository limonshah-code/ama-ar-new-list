      "This Umbrella Fishing Bait Rigs Kit is very simple, because the swimbait and the jighead are perfectly combined, you can\u2019t see many scattered accessories, just hang the swimbait on the Rigs arms and you can use it.",

      "The product you bought has 2 sets of Umbrella fishing rigs with 2 colors. If you are careful, you will definitely find that the swimbait are very different in length and size. Remember to hang the largest swim bait in the last position of arms when using it. because the fish usually attack the lagging fish, if them sees that the swimbait is the largest, it will not hesitate to attack and will not miss the perfect opportunity",
      "I have another suggestion. You can mix different colors of swimming baits. For example, you can use 4 small green baits. Use white for the big bait at the last position. This will make it easier to attract the attention of big fishes. They have a difference in color. very sensitive",
      "The largest swimbait has a weight of 26 grams, and the resistance is also high. If you drag the alabama rigs manually, it will feel heavy after long time use. It is recommended that you use a lighter swimbait to search, when you find fish, and then use the biger swimbait to attract the big fish, This fishing Rigs uses boat trolling is the best, whether it is fresh or salt water."
