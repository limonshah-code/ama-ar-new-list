It helps fight bad breath, prevent gum disease, and reduce the risk of cavities. With multiple water pressure settings, it\u2019s easy to customize your cleaning experience: higher pressure levels are ideal for smokers or those who drink coffee, tea, or wine regularly, helping to target stubborn stains.

It's lightweight yet stable, so it stays put and won't tip over during use. For optimal results, we recommend using the water flosser first to remove debris and clean between teeth, followed by brushing. This allows the fluoride from your toothpaste to stay on your teeth longer and do its job. Brushing and flossing with water at the same time may dilute the toothpaste, reducing its effectiveness"
