      "Fast Heating with Durable & Safe Design \u2013 The aquarium heater is made of explosion-resistant quartz glass and high-temperature resistant nickel-chromium for quick heat transfer and reliable performance in both saltwater and freshwater tanks. Dual sensor probes provide more accurate temperature monitoring, while the PC plastic protective cover prevents direct contact, ensuring your fish stay safe from burns.",
      "Easy Operation with External Controller \u2013 The submersible fish tank heater comes with a convenient external controller for easy and precise temperature adjustment. Press the \u201cSET\u201d button to enter the temperature setting mode, and each press increases the set temperature by 1\u00b0F/1\u00b0C within the 59\u00b0F\u201393\u00b0F (15\u00b0C\u201334\u00b0C) range. Press and hold for 5 seconds to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius.",
      "Overheating & Dry-Run Protection \u2013 The fish tank heater will automatically shut off when the water temp reaches set temp. If the temp rises rapidly 3\u00b0F/3\u00b0C higher than set temp , the heater will stop heating immediately and a flashing alert will appear on the controller. When the heating rod is exposed more than 1 inch above water, an \u201cE0\u201d error code appears and heating stops. The protection systerm prevents overheating and dry burn, keeping your fish safe",
      "Intelligent Automatic Heating \u2013 The AQQA aquarium heater adopts automatic thermostatic control. It stops heating when the water reaches the set temperature and automatically restarts when the temperature drops 2\u00b0C/\u00b0F below the set point. The memory function retains your settings after a power outage, making it more convenient to unplug the power cord for water changes.",
      "Usage Instructions \u2013 Always fully submerge the aquarium heater in water before plugging it in, and ensure proper water circulation in the tank. After turning it off, allow the heater to cool in the water for 15\u201330 minutes to prevent residual heat from damaging the cover. Following these safety tips helps extend the lifespan of your fish heater. For any issues, feel free to contact us"
