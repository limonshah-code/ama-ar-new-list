Our innovative 12-zone air support system, placed discreetly under your mattress, restores sagging and unsupportive mattresses in just minutes. Whether you have an innerspring, memory foam, or hybrid mattress, Mattress ReNew works with all mattress types and sizes\u2014Twin, Full, Queen, and King. Simply add air to the areas that require extra support, and your mattress feels like new again.",
      "Custom Fit for Every Mattress Size: For Twin and Full mattresses, simply fold away any unused air chambers. For King-sized mattresses with multiple sagging areas, you may need two Mattress ReNew units to address separate dips. If the sagging is centralized, one unit is all you need for a quick and effective fix.",
      "Adjustable for Perfect Support: When uninflated, Mattress ReNew is as thin as a pamphlet, but when inflated, it offers anywhere from 1/8\" to over 6\" of lift. While you'll likely never need the full 6\", you have complete control over the level of support, adjusting it precisely where your mattress needs it most.",
      "Why Choose Mattress ReNew? We\u2019re a family-owned U.S. business with over 20 years of experience in the home furniture and mattress industry in California and Texas. We invented Mattress ReNew after hearing countless complaints about sagging mattresses, including our own. Traditional foam pads don\u2019t address the real issue and break down just like your mattress. That\u2019s why we designed a product that truly works\u2014backed by years of research and development."
