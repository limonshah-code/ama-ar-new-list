Additionally, brass fittings and a water-stop are included, adding years of enhanced performance and reliability to your plumbing system",
      "\u3010Designed for robust functionality\u3011: CrestWave Hot Water Recirculating pump operates at a voltage of 110-120V (60Hz), with a powerful 125W motor. It boasts a maximum flow rate of 30 LPM and can handle a head height of up to 30 feet (9 meters). The pump's fluid temperature range from 0\u2109 to 212\u2109 ensures excellent performance in both extreme cold and high-heat conditions\u2014all while maintaining a low noise level of just 25dB, so it runs quietly in the background",
      "\u3010Designed for Flexibility\u3011: CrestWave Hot Water Recirculating pump features both manual and automatic operation modes. For optimal performance in auto mode, ensure the water inlet pressure is above 3 PSI (0.2bar). The auto mode conveniently turns the pump on or off depending on your needs, ensuring that you conserve energy when hot water isn't required. On the other hand, the manual mode allows for constant circulation, which can be particularly useful during colder months when you want to prevent your pipes from freezing",
      "\u3010Installation is a breeze\u3011: Requiring just a wrench to connect the pump to your existing pipeline. The pump is also equipped with an extra NPT 1/2\u201d adapter for added convenience. Its user-friendly design not only reduces installation costs but also ensures seamless integration into your current hot water system",
      "\u3010Wide Range of Applications\u3011: This versatile pump is suitable for a wide range of applications, including city buildings, suburban homes, villas, and even industrial equipment. Whether you need to circulate water through an air conditioning system, boiler, or solar water heater, this pump ensures consistent water pressure and temperature, providing comfort and convenience in every setting",

      "\u3010Tips: Air Purging\u3011: For the pump to run correctly after being installed or after manintenance, discharge the air from inside the pump before strating it. Use a flathead screwdriver to open the air release valve on the front of the pump, release any internal air completely.",
      "\u3010Tips: Exercise caution against dry running\u3011: After connecting the pipes, ensure the system is filled with water before powering on the pump. This prevents damage from dry running.",
      "Notes: This product is a 2-in-1 circulation and booster pump: in auto mode, its core function is water pressure boosting (to resolve insufficient water pressure); in manual mode, its core function is circulation (to enable hot water pre-flow). It not only addresses the need for pressure boosting to fix low household water pressure, but also meets the requirement for hot water circulation in water heaters (reducing cold water waste), making it suitable for the plumbing setups of most households."
