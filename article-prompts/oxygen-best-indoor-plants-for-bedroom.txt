      "TOLERANT, VERTICAL GROWER: Devil's Tongue Plant is incredibly tough and will grow indoors in dimly lit areas (similar to other low light house plants) but will prefer moderate to bright indirect sunlight (it may even enjoy direct sun from time to time). Drought-tolerant, this species does not require much water and nearly thrives on neglect, making it the perfect houseplant for beginning growers.",

Sansevieria succulents are cared for within a rotated nursery stock with other potted plants prior to shipment, prepared for home decor. Each plant ships fully rooted in a 4 inch grow pot and is estimated to range from 9-11 inches tall (measured from the rim of the pot)."
