One pair of disposable chopsticks can be used for once. So suppose one person uses chopsticks twice a day, one pair of metal reusable chopsticks equal to 40 pairs of wooden chopsticks, or 7300 pairs of disposable chopsticks. Thinking of the tons of chopsticks turn to rubbish every year, the stainless steel chopsticks are really Eco-friendly."
