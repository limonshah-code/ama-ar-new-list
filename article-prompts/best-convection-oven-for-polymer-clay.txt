The larger mat pairs with the diamond baking grid, while the small one lines the baking tray\u2014both ensuring your polymer clay never touches metal directly to prevent scorching, indents, or yellowing.

This way, you can achieve consistent, professional-level baking every time",
      "Pro Baking Tips for Perfect Results:#1-Since baking temperatures and times can vary based on clay brand, thickness, and formula, we always recommend following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for best results. For example, if 120\u00b0C is recommended, place your piece in the oven once the thermometer shows a stable 120\u00b0C;#2-Thicker pieces can be baked longer without burning\u2014polymer clay remains stable even with extended curing. If you\u2019re trying a new brand of clay, we suggest testing a small sample first to determine your ideal time and temperature"
