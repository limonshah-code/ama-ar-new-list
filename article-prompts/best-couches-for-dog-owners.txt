The leather's sturdy and durable nature allows your dog to jump and play freely without leaving marks.",
      "Suitable for Pets Under 50lbs - This dog sofa bed is filled with high-resilience memory foam in the base and armrests, offering both support and softness. A cotton layer sandwiched between the foam and leather not only creates a smooth silhouette but also adds to its soft touch. The 16.9''*17.7'' sleeping area is large enough to accommodate small and medium dogs weighing no more than 50 pounds, while the extended armrests and backrest provide more stretching space.",

After waiting 24-48 hours, the high-density foam will fully expand to its maximum fluffiness. Patting and smoothing the sponge will make its filling more even and improve the overall appearance of the sofa."
