      "FEATURE: M42 high-speed steel is formulated with a high 8% cobalt, high hardness and wear resistance, especially suitable for processing hard materials, excellent heat resistance, suitable for high-speed cutting. The titanium nitride (tin) coated can prevent further oxidation or corrosion of the drill bits and extend the service life.",
      "APPLICATION: The M42 material drill bit has a high 8% cobalt content, mainly used in demanding professional drilling operations, making it suitable for processing medium-high hard metals. It is suitable for drilling various materials, including stainless steel, iron, aluminum, copper, plastics, and wood.",

The harder the material, the lower the drilling speed should be. Adjusting the speed can improve cutting efficiency, extend tool life, and reduce material damage."
