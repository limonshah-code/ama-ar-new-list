      "TOP RETURN REASON: \"IT'S WAY TOO THIN!\" The standard sized Extra Slim pillow is for those who need an EXTREMELY slim pillow profile, or something just barely thicker than no pillow at all. It's only 1.75\" high and made from premium memory foam, so your head will sink to just about an inch above the mattress.",
      "ADVANCED COOLING FEATURES: Gel\u2011infused foam works with built\u2011in ventilation channels to move heat away from your head and increase airflow, so you stay cool and comfortable until morning.",
      "PREMIUM, SUPPORTIVE MEMORY FOAM: Our CertiPUR-US certified gel memory foam offers medium firm support without excessive height. It cradles your head and neck, helps open your airways, and may ease snoring and pressure on your shoulders and back.",
      "SOFT, WASHABLE COVER: A zippered, removable cover makes it simple to clean. Just toss it in the washer and dryer to keep the pillow hygienic and feeling like new.",
      "WHY CHOOSE BLUEWAVE? We're a family-owned business committed to innovation and exceptional customer support. Explore our multiple height options: 1.75\", 2.25\", 2.75\", 3.25\", or 4\" loft, with advanced CarbonBlue cooling technology available on certain models.",
