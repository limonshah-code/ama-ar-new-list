      "Introducing the Garvee Stainless Steel Double Trash Can, a sleek and practical solution for efficient waste and recycling management in your kitchen. This dual bin system combines style, durability, and functionality to keep your space clean and organized.",
      "Sleek Aesthetic with Compact Footprint: Measuring just 18.74 in long and 14.80 in wide, this trash can fits perfectly in tight spaces while offering a large capacity of two 10.6 gal bins. The height aligns neatly with standard kitchen island countertops, making it both unobtrusive and accessible.",
      "Fingerprint-Resistant Stainless Steel and Thoughtful Design: The smudge-free stainless steel finish maintains a polished look with minimal cleaning effort. An integrated liner rim hides bag edges for a seamless appearance, and anti-slip rubber feet ensure stability on various floor types. Inner buckets feature lips for easy, touch-free liner removal.",
      "Durable, High-Quality Materials: Crafted from 410-grade ferritic stainless steel, this bin resists rust, scratches, and dents. The polypropylene inner buckets repel stains and odors, while the robust ABS lid and industrial-grade pedal withstand extensive use, promising longevity and reliability.",
      "Practical and User-Friendly Features: Ergonomic side handles make moving the bin effortless. The soft-close lid opens smoothly up to 80 degrees and locks at 95 degrees for hands-free use during cooking. Weighted lids on the inner buckets trap odors separately, and the custom liner ring keeps bags secure without slipping or bunching."
