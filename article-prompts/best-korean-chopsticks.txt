Those metal chopsticks made of 304 stainless steel won't get rusty like the low quality steel chopsticks. Our stainless chopsticks weigh 33g per pair, comparing with those metal chopsticks weigh 20g or less, our metal chopsticks use more material, which ensures the sturdy quality. The best choice for safe and durable reusable chopsticks.",
      "\u273f \u3010Unique Laser Engraving Pattern\u3011: The metal chopsticks are with permanent laser-engraved pattern. No fading after long time use.

The reason why the wooden/bamboo chopsticks get moldy easily is due to their loose construction. There are thousands of tiny holes that gain food residue and liquid during use. It is very hard to get rid of them during the normal cleaning process. Metal chopsticks with solid construction are free from that trouble. That is why the metal reusable chopsticks are healthier.",
