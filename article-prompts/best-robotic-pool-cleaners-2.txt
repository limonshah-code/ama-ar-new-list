      "120-Minute Ultra-Long Working Time: The A1 boasts an extended runtime of up to 120 minutes (suitable for flat-bottom pools), a 50-100% increase from last year. Additionally, the suction port is twice the size of the previous generation, allowing for the suction of larger debris. The maximum cleaning area reaches 1076 sq.ft, meeting the cleaning needs of most above-ground flat-bottom pools.",
      "2.5-hour Fast Charging: Equipped with the latest fast-charging technology, an instant pool cleaning experience is no longer a dream. Breaking away from the long charging times of 6-7 hours in the past, now it only takes 2.5 hours to get a cordless pool robot with powerful dirt suction.",
      "User-friendly Interface: The charging port, power button, and LED indicator lights of WYBOT A1 are all conveniently located on the top of the machine, unlike other machines where they are situated at the bottom. This design greatly enhances customer convenience, resulting in a more user-friendly interaction interface."
