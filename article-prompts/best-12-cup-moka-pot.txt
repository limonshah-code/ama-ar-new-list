      "Note 1: Due to the moka pot thermal conductivity is better, if the heating fire is too large, it is easy to cause the bottom of the pot to burn(not rust), so please pay attention to the size of the fire and the control of the stewing time. Therefore, discoloration of the bottom of a moka pot is normal and does not affect its performance or safety. After using the moka pot, please clean it promptly and turn it upside down to dry. Keep the moka pot dry, as prolonged exposure to water may cause rusting",
      "Note 2: The description of a few cups is actually a unit of measurement rather than the actual number of cups of coffee that can be produced. 4 cup of coffee pot does not necessarily produce 4 cup of coffee, depending on the actual capacity"
