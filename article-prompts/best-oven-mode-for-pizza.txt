      "Easy to Clean: It's normal for your pizza stone to develop dark spots from scattered flour dust during use. After baking, you can scrape them off while the stone is still warm using a pizza peel. For tougher residue, let the stone cool completely and clean with baking soda. Always make sure the stone is completely dry before next use.",
      "Versatile Pizza Oven: More than just pizza, the Zachvo indoor countertop oven lets you grill steak, roast vegetables, bake cakes, dehydrate fruits, and keep foods warm\u2014all with one compact kitchen appliance.",
      "Some Helpful Usage Tips: After baking, please do not unplug the pizza oven immediately. Because the interior remains very hot, press the power-off button and allow the cooling fan to run for about 10 minutes before unplugging. This helps protect the components and extend the oven\u2019s lifespan."
