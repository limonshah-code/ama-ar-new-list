      "[Hold Constant Pressure & Lock PSI Settings] Hilangsan dual stage kegerator co2 regulator reduces the high pressure in two steps for maintaining the constant output pressure, which achieves a stable output pressure. Adjustment knob of the kegerator regulator has a locking nut that locks the PSI to prevent accidental \"bumped/turned\" from adjusting your PSI. A professional CO2 regulator for draft beer dispenser systems.",
      "[Easy-to-Adjust Knob & Safety Relief Valve] Knurled adjustment knobs of the beer keg regulators are easy to grip and turn for precise fine-tuning CO2 levels from 0-50psi. The shut-off valve of the co2 regulator can be closed only by turning 90\u00b0, no need to turn multiple turns. The pressure relief valve will automatically release the keg pressure at around 50psi pressure for safety (not a leak).",
      "[Precise and Clear Gauges] The top gauge(0-60psi) of kegerator regulator has an appropriate scale range to allow for precise fine-tuning of keg pressure. The left gauge (0-3000psi) is convenient for monitoring the amount of CO2 in the tank at any time. The shockproof case can protect the CO2 regulator gauges, making the gauges more durable.",
      "[Solid Constructions&No Leak] Heavy-duty chrome-plated brass construction would last for years with no rust. The beer keg regulator is supplied with sealing washers. Pacing a washer between the CGA-320 inlet and the tank ensures a tight seal, no CO2 leak!",
      "[Swivel Thread End Fitting] You can install a 1/4\" barb or a 5/16\" barb on the keg regulator as needed, allowing for a quick disconnect from your CO2 gas hose. Or attach your own push-on fitting to connect your EVA gas hose.",
      "[Reliable Service] 2-year warranty and lifetime technical support. We are committed to providing you with quality products and services, please feel free to tell us if any problems, and we would try our best to satisfy you."
