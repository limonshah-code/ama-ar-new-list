This design significantly enhances operator safety during use. Additionally, the dual-switch control system extends the service life of individual motors, resulting in more stable operation and quieter performance.\uff08Important Note: Never activate both switches simultaneously during operation to prevent power adapter overload and potential accidents.\uff09",

To extend the motor's lifespan, an internal dedicated blade compartment prevents dust from splattering and affecting motor operation, while an external dust extraction tube is included for dust collection and cleaning.",
      "\u3010Comprehensive Upgrade - Blade, Sanding Disc, and Worktable\u3011The upgraded larger 80-85mm blade increases the adjustable height range to 0-26mm, with a maximum cutting thickness of 26mm (compared to 16mm in the old model). The enlarged 3.15-inch sanding disc improves efficiency for large-area sanding tasks. The widened worktable has been extended from 9cm to 12cm, allowing customized cutting of materials up to 12cm in length. These enhancements significantly boost your overall efficiency.",
