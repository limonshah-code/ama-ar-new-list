      "Note: If you need to use it for a long time, it is recommended to adjust the elastic band to a proper position (where it won't fall off and there is not much pressure on the ears). When sleeping, sound is not the only influencing factor; comfort also needs to be taken into account. The headband is made of soft and elastic polyester fabric, durable, not easy to deform, smooth skin feel, comfortable to wear. It can be adjusted by hook and loop strips .",
      "In order to enhance the noise reduction effect, we recommend using them together with sponge earplugs, which will significantly improve the noise reduction. We've included a storage bag to make them easy to carry around and to prevent microscopic residue from adhering to the ear cups.",
      "Earmuffs are available in both sponge and silicone for the part of the ear pads that comes into direct contact with the skin. Sponge ear pads are the same as normal earmuffs, while silicone ear pads are more comfortable. Our earmuffs have air holes to equalize air pressure and prevent damage to the eardrums caused by the air pressure generated when wearing the earmuffs. At the same time, the air holes have a little ventilation effect to avoid the ears feeling stuffy.",
      "The ear cups are designed with double-layer high-density sound-isolating cotton, which can effectively reduce low-frequency noise, but not completely isolate the noise. Our earmuffs have a significant noise reduction effect in the following scenarios: Noise from air conditioning, fan, and keyboard. Noise from the living room TV or talking. Noise from neighbors and the upper and lower floors. Animals' barking. Noise from street traffic, highway , construction sites. The sound of snoring, etc.",
      "Our earmuffs are not as comfortable as expected when sleeping on your side, with limited improvement if you can use them with a very soft pillow. Since the human ear is sensitive to the human voice, most earmuffs don't do much for the human voice. People speak at about 40-60 decibels when speaking normally and 60-90 decibels when arguing. Noise greater than 40 decibels interferes with sleep comfort, and greater than 60 decibels creates a more noticeable disturbance."
