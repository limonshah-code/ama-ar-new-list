Changes in the outside temperature cause deformation without affecting the use.",
      "\ud83d\udc1d\u3010Easy and Safe to Use\u3011Firstly ensure that the surface is free from dust and dirt. Apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the wood using a sponge or soft cloth. Leave for about 15-30 minutes to allow the wood to absorb the oils in the beeswax. Then wipe off the excess with a clean, soft cloth. Allow the furniture to dry naturally: in a dry, ventilated area, it will take at least 2 hours and may take up to 24 hours to dry completely.",

It forms a protective film on the wooden surface, which keeps the furniture its natural and beautiful appearance for a long time.",

It is also the best choice for arts and crafts. Safe on all treated woods.",
      "\u2709\u3010Note\u3011Although beeswax is made from natural ingredients, please do not consume it. It is normal for sponges to wrinkle. Sponges are elastic and will automatically return to their original shape within minutes, which does not affect their usability."
