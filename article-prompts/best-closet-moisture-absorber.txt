    "brand": "CLEVAST",
    "features": [
      "EFFECTIVE DEHUMIDIFICATION: The CLEVAST dehumidifier bags feature spherical calcium chloride particles that can attract and absorb excess moisture quickly and efficiently. Moisture absorbers are designed with a premium one-way moisture-permeable paper that will securely lock the moisture inside.(WHEN the temperature drops sharply or the humidity is low, crystals may appear inside the bag, and no water droplets at the bottom. This is normal, please be patient for the product to work)",
      "VISIBLE DEHUMIDIFYING PROCESS: The CLEVAST absorber bags capture excess moisture in the air and trap it to a large 500ml water storage. The accumulated water through the dehumidification effect can be observed anytime. Dehumidifier bags can be used for up to 60 days (NOTE: If the environmental humidity is low, it will not exceed the 500ml water level. Duration will vary depending on temperature and humidity).",
      "EASY TO USE & STORAGE: No assembly is required. Each closet moisture absorber is stored in a separate bag for easy use and long-term storage. These can be hung anywhere for physical dehumidification. These dehumidifier bags feature an easy-to-hang hook, taking up just a little space in your room.",
      "WIDE APPLICATION: Our safe moisture absorber bags are suitable for most enclosed spaces, such as basements, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, laundry rooms, warehouses, and caravans. All you need to do is remove the outer plastic bag and hang it in the damp space where excess moisture is an issue. Then, you can enjoy a dry and comfortable indoor environment for a long time. Do NOT place near valuables.",
      "How It Works: When using moisture absorber bags, the white calcium chloride dissolves and forms a whole piece, leading to water droplets appearing in 3-5 days. As dehumidification continues, more water will collect in the catchment area. In high humidity, the white calcium chloride will dissolve into pieces and become liquid in a short time (about 3-7 days). In low humidity, transparent crystals may form in storage areas. Initial solidification of the dehumidifier can occur, but it will absorb moisture over time, turning into liquid."
