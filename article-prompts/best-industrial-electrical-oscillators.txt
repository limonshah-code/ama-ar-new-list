      "\u3010Working Principle\u3011The linear welding swinging device provides a digital signal through microcomputer control, driving a stepper motor to drive the ball screw. The ultimate goal is to achieve precise swinging of the welding gun along the direction of the weld seam. Can improve the formation of molten pool edges and eliminate edge-biting defects",
      "\u3010High Productivity\u3011During the welding process, the automatic welding oscillator can effectively increase the width of the weld seam. It's rate load is 2.5kg. Obtaining multiple welding effects with one welding. Greatly improved productivity",
      "\u3010Easy to Operate\u3011This linear type MIG machine can pre-store 10 sets of swing programs. And the program can be switched freely during the swing process. Suitable for work scenarios that require multiple layers of swinging. The oscillator input and output interfaces can be easily left with a combination of welding positioner, welding wheel frame welding and the like using a cross-arm automatic or semi-automatic welding. Even beginners can easily operate it",
      "\u3010High Precision\u3011The width of the weld seam can be precisely controlled and adjusted during the swinging process. It is possible to realize automatic adjustment of the left, right and middle dwell time without stopping during the welding swing to realize the increase of the local welding time. Effective to improve precision",
      "\u3010Wide Range of Application\u3011Welding oscillator is mainly suitable for MIG/MAG(GMAW), TIG(TIG), plasma welding and other welding torch swing. Widely used for welding fillet welds, pressure vessels, flanges, steel, shipbuilding, piping, etc., can replace a large number of skilled welders, access to quality and efficient welding process"
