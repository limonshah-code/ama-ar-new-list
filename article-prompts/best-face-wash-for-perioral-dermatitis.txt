Disrupt the Biofilm - certain irritants create a biofilm shield that protects it from targeted treatment. 2. Clear the Bad Bugs - Once the biofilm is removed, you can clear away the dirt, oil and other skin irritants easier than ever. 3. Soothe the Skin - Now it\u2019s time to nourish and hydrate your skin WITHOUT using lipids (like coconut oil) that feed the irritated skin and promote acne.",

Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Squalane, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xylitol, Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba (Guar) Gum, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba (Willow Bark) Bark Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Benzyl Alcohol. That\u2019s it. No fragrances, parabens, or hard-to-pronounce ingredients.",
      "There's a reason your manuka honey gel, hydrocortisone ointment, and specialized face wash isn't working - they aren't disrupting the biofilm (so they can't reach the skin aggravator) and they use oils that feed the problem. Put an end to your facial seborrheic dermatitis nightmare and gain peaceful skin and peace of mind with Dermazen. *Results amplified when combined with the Calming Seborrheic Serum.",
      "Are you tired of buying face and beard wash, lotion and medicated creams marketed for eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis only to find out that it not only doesn't work, but it made your condition worse? We were too, which is why we created Dermazen to calm the itch, eliminate dry flaky skin, and promote moisturizing for even the most sensitive skin."
