After repair, it is airtight and waterproof, flexible and durable, suitable for underwater and outdoor environments, and is not easy to fall off or crack after long-term use",
      "Complete Accessories: The pvc pipe glue contains enough blue and transparent repair sheets. The blue PVC sheet is scratch-resistant and anti-deformation, and is perfectly compatible with most pool liners. The transparent sheet takes into account both aesthetics and UV resistance to avoid yellowing, which is suitable for repairs with high requirements for appearance. The dual-material design meets the needs of different scenarios and greatly improves the efficiency and aesthetics of repairs",
      "Wide Range Of Uses: The pvc cement is suitable for self-adhesion and mutual adhesion of various materials such as PVC, ABS, EVA, rubber, etc., covering repair scenes such as inflatable beds, trampolines, swimming pools, boats, canvas, kayaks, etc. Especially suitable for the rapid repair of materials such as above-ground pool liners, tarpaulins, fiberglass, etc.",
      "Simple Operation: Equipped with a special brush head, the vinyl cement is smooth and easy to apply, and the bonding is more uniform. After cleaning and drying the surface, apply glue, fit the patch and press it firmly. It will reach the best strength in 24 hours. No complicated tools are needed, and novices can easily complete professional-level repairs",
      "Sealed Packaging: The specially designed screw-on cover creates a secure seal to prevent leaks and keep your vinyl adhesive from drying out, ensuring maximum usability every time. If the lid is tight, simply ask for assistance or use pliers for easy opening\u2014saving you time and product",
      "Usage Tip: The key to successfully repairing cracks is to apply the proper amount of vinyl glue adhesive to the patch and spread it evenly. Vinyl glue is a solvent-based adhesive, so it is not recommended to apply too much or too thick an amount of adhesive to a lightweight patch to prevent the patch from softening, curling, or further damaging the surface of the repair, which could affect the repair"
