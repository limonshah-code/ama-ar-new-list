Looking for a factory-lubed, plug-and-play silent switch that lets you immerse yourself in a whisper-quiet typing experience? What\u2019s more, the EPOMAKER Silent Switch is equipped with top-tier shock absorption technology, which effectively eliminates key noise. Whether you\u2019re working late at night or in a shared office space, you can still maintain full focus without disturbing others. Its pre-lubrication process ensures every keystroke is silky-smooth and seamless, remaining stable and reliable even with long-term use.",
      "Factory Lubed, Worry-Free Performance: Pre-lubed at the factory and engineered with a specialized structure, the Epomaker Silent Switch self-lubricates with every keystroke. Its self-lubing mechanism relies on precision-machined grooves in the stem: with each press, these grooves evenly distribute the factory-applied lubricant across all moving components\u2014removing the hassle of frequent re-lubrication entirely. Crafted from high-grade POM, the stem delivers exceptional wear resistance, maintaining its shape and ultra-smooth feel even after 50+ million keystrokes.",
      "MX-Compatible & Hot-Swappable: The EPOMAKER Silent Switch features a standard 5-pin design, which strengthens the connection stability between the switch and PCB through multi-pin positioning. This effectively reduces wobble and minimizes the risk of poor contact during long-term use or frequent plug-and-unplug cycles, while being compatible with the vast majority of hot-swappable mechanical keyboards on the market. Its stem adopts the classic MX structure design, allowing perfect compatibility with various MX cross-stem structure keycaps, enabling users to easily enjoy the personalized fun of DIY keyboards.",

This provides more fun feature and options for DIYers. With a strong stainless steel spring, the lifespan can go up to 60 million times of keystrokes based on laboratory durability test. Get your keyboard something new and have fun with them!",
      "Compatibility Reminder: The EPOMAKER Silent mechanical switch is compatible with most mechanical keyboards available on the market. However, it is incompatible with low-profile mechanical keyboards, optical mechanical keyboards, and magnetic mechanical keyboards."
