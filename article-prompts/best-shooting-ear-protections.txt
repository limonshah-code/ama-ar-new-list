      "NOISE REDUCTION - Ear Buds provide NRR 25 dB (Noise Reduction Rating) protection against gun blasts through SAC (Sound Activated Compression)",
      "COMFORTABLE FIT - Walkers Compact In The Ear Buds won't interfere with you or your gun and cone with Secure-Lock sizing fins (comes with 3 different sized countered fins and foam buds) provides a tight and a customized fit",
      "EASY TO CONTROL - Integrated Omni directional microphones and full dynamic range speakers deliver a crisp clear sound; The speakers feature independent volume control and an off/on switch",
      "DETAILS - Walker's Digital Ear Buds run on two #10 batteries (includes 4), and come with a removable lanyard and a carry case for easy transportation",
      "Batteries can drain while in storage so users can take them out between uses. Also be sure to store ear buds in a low humidity environment. Battery draining faster in one ear over the other could be due to one directional sound causing one to work more than the other. The primary use for the ear pieces is for suppressing loud sounds, not for carrying conversations as with using these as a hearing aid."
