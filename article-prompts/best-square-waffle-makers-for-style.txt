      "DOUBLE SIDED BAKING: Unlike other brands of waffle makers that may feature single-sided heating or uneven heating, our commercial waffle maker heats both the top and bottom sides. This double-sided heating design of our square waffle iron ensures even heat distribution on both sides, making sure that both sides of the waffle have the same texture and color. Moreover, it minimizes the issue of the waffles sticking due to uneven heating. As a result, the waffles release more easily from the baking pan, and it makes cleaning the baking pan breeze.",

The cast aluminum baking plates, with a smooth surface and high heat conductivity, evenly cook waffles. There is a layer of Teflon coating on the surface. The function of this coating is that it is not easy to stick to the pan and it can withstand high temperatures.",
