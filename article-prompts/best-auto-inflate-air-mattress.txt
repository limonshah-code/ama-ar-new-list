      "48-Hour Leak Tested \u2013 Enhanced Airtight Design: Worried your queen size air mattress might feel softer by morning? Each queen blow up mattress is factory leak-tested for up to 48 hours to support reliable airtight performance. A multi-layer sealed build helps maintain steady firmness through the night. During the first 1\u20132 nights, the PVC may naturally stretch under inflation pressure\u2014this is normal. Just add a quick top-up if needed",
      "18\" Raised, Stable Edges \u2013 Just Like a Real Bed: Sitting on the edge shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re slipping off.

Start it while you grab bedding, then press to stop at your preferred firmness. It folds compactly and weighs just 16 lbs, making the queen blow up bed easy to store, carry, and set up anywhere",
      "Normal PVC Expansion After 2-3 Days: Upon first use, the queen inflatable bed material will stretch and may feel slightly softer after initial inflation. This is a normal part of the material's break-in process and is NOT a leak! The mattress will fully stabilize within 2-3 days. We recommend a daily inflation to maintain your desired firmness during this period"
