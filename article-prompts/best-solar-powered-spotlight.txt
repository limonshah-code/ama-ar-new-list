      "SOLAR POWERED LIGHT: This LED spotlight does not require batteries or electricity to operate as it has built-in industrial quality solar panels that absorb the sun\u2019s rays during the day and uses that stored energy for an all-night\u2019s worth of illumination!",
      "EASY-TO-USE and INSTALL: And since the Bionic Spotlight is solar-powered, say good bye to cumbersome, ugly wiring that seems to snag pets, people, and machinery that happen to pass by; and of course, no more frequent, and expensive battery changes. Now you can save money, and relax!",
      "AUTOMATIC ON and OFF the Bell and Howell Bionic Spotlight is designed with motion sensing technology that can detect movement 25 feet away. It turns on automatically and shuts off 60 seconds after movement is outside sensor range.",
      "ALL SEASON and LONG LASTING: It is made from high-quality durable materials that are rated as weather resistant, allowing for an all-season use, whether it\u2019s raining or snowing. The Bionic Spotlight is also built with heat-resistant casing that prevents sun-induced warping or discoloration.",
      "BRIGHTER with BIGGER COVERAGE: The Deluxe Bionic Spotlight is 50% brighter than other similar products and is powerful enough to illuminate about 600 square feet worth of space. Once activated, the light also takes a longer time before it enters sleep mode again."
