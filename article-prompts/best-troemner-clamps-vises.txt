      "High-Quality Castings: The bench vise is forged from an all-steel base material, with a chrome-plated spindle and nut fixed support. The jaw adopts quenching & reburning technology to enhance hardness and strength. It can basically meet the fixed usage requirements of most objects, resist deformation under extreme pressure, and ensure reliable use in workshops for decades",
      "Complete installation kit: 1 fully lacquered orange bench clamp, 4 bowling sticks to hold posts, 4 special soft rubber protective covers for clamping posts, 2 non-slip rubber gaskets. There are 10 holes, which can be fixed according to your different needs for the product",
      "360\u00b0 spherical design: The head can be rotated 360\u00b0, oblique side can be tilted up to 45\u00b0, and the whole is smooth. Compared with the traditional table vise pivot, the rotation is more flexible and integrated, making it convenient for you to use fixed supports at multiple angles. This professional-level flexibility is superior to standard bench pliers and clips",
      "Technical specifications: The maximum height of the table clamp can reach 12.5 inches, the maximum opening of the workbench vise mouth can reach 3.2 inches, and the width is approximately 3 inches. It is suitable for DIY, woodworking, metal parts processing, and industrial workshops",
      "Prevent scratches: The fixed workbench is equipped with rubber pads to prevent the desktop from wearing due to force. The jaws are provided with non-slip rubber gaskets. The soft rubber gaskets can prevent products such as guns and pipes from sliding or scratching their surfaces when they are fixed",
      "Safety usage reminder: It is not recommended to increase the leverage force of the woodworking vise, or to extend the distance between the two sides of the screw. Excessive pressure will easily cause instability of the jaws"
