    "features": [
      "Making repetitive cuts on your table saw is a pretty straight forward process. Set your fence and feed each stock piece through the blade to achieve the same size each and every time. What if you need a series of narrow cuts that are about an 2 inches or less in width? Doing this can get tricky since you cant get your hands safely between the blade and the fence. You could always reverse measure and keep the off fall piece, but without a guide of some sort that can be inaccurate.",
      "The Thin Rip Jig acts kind of like a third hand behind the blade or cutter. With the saw unplugged simply measure from the outside of of the blade toward the tip of the (guide roller) Thin Rip Jig for the width cut you want to make. Once set, secure the Thin Rip Jig simply by rotating the large, easy to grip star shaped knob. After your first cut, reset your stock behind the blade and slide the fence over so your stock piece is touching the guide roller on the Thin Rip Jig. Lock the fence.",
      "Making your thin rip cuts in this fashion allows you to cut wider boards down without getting your fingers in harms way by keep them away from the blade or cutter.The Thin Rip works much like a feather except that it doesn\u2019t exert spring like pressure against the board. This means it can be used to make accurate, repetitive cuts since it\u2019s essentially just holding its spot once it is secured.",
      "The Thin Rip Jig has a roller guide bearing on the tip to make feeding your stock through an easy and smooth moving process. The free rotating bearing is made from high quality materials for extended workshop use. The jig fits directly into most any standard 3/8\u201d x 3/4\u201d miter slot. The body is made from a solid piece of aluminum and is adjustable inward and outward from your fence depending on the width of your stock.",
      "The jig can be used on other workshop machinery like router tables with fences and band saws for re-saw applications. In certain cases, when working with larger or longer stock on table saws or router tables, we recommend using two thin rip jigs behind the blade or cutter for extra stability when feeding your stock through."
