Sodafall dispensers are also compatible with soda pops; however, due to their sweetener content, the soda may foam up during the dispensing process, potentially leading to a slight loss of carbonation.",
      "VERY IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS for best results! Dispenser was designed and made for plain seltzer/club soda, so it works best with these. It also works with soda pops but they need to be highly carbonated!! Dispenser uses the pressure in the bottle to work, so if there is not enough carbonation=there is not enough pressure. It's physics! Carbonation in soda bottles can vary from bottle to bottle due to syrup content or proper/poor storage"
