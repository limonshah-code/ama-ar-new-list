Whether you\u2019re looking for a sealing product for the first time or a resealer for long-lasting protection, this product can give your granite surfaces the before and after results you want to see. Great for Quartz, Marble, Granite, Quartzite, and Soapstone.",
      "Advanced-Action Stain Protection \u2013 This spray uses a powerful blend of polymers to penetrate the stone\u2019s naturally porous surface to block out stains from seeping in and becoming permanent. By doing this, TriNova\u2019s Granite Sealer also provides a protective layer on top of the granite to prevent water spotting and to keep other residue from sticking.",
      "Enhances Existing Gloss and Shine \u2013 TriNova\u2019s Granite Sealer and Protectant is essential when the time comes to treat all types of stone and enhance surfaces for a polished and natural look. The sealer and protectant works by enhancing the existing shine, but will not create shine on already dulled surfaces. It works miracles on grout to guard against stains that develop between your shower or bath tiles that can be the most difficult to remove with just a sponge, no matter how hard you scrub.",
      "Do the Water Test - The best test to see if your granite needs to be sealed is to put drops of water in certain sections of your granite and wait 30 minutes. If the granite absorbs the water, you need to reseal. If not, your granite is protected. However, we still recommend using the Granite Sealer at least once a month to prevent stains from happening in the future.",
      "Trust TriNova - We have a 100 percent satisfaction guarantee. If you aren't absolutely satisfied with your TriNova purchase, just tell us and we'll refund the purchase price. That's how much we believe in our products."
