      "Durable Material: Made of excellent TPE and food-grade silicone materials, portable washer machine is durable and safe for daily use; designed for washing delicate clothes such as underwear, socks, and baby clothes, provides a gentle and efficient washing experience; blue light deep washing protection can improve cleanliness and promote healthy living",
      "Energy and Quiet: Collapsible washing machine significantly reduces water and electricity consumption, helping you save water and electricity bills while reducing green burden; equipped with a low-energy noise reduction motor to ensure smooth operation of the washing machine and reduce shaking during operation, allowing you to enjoy a quiet washing experience",
      "Note: The high-speed spin drain basket effectively extracts a significant amount of moisture from laundry after washing, reducing moisture and speeding up subsequent air-drying. However, this does not completely remove moisture, and laundry will remain damp and require air-drying. This is not a tumble dryer."
