      "Q: Why doesn\u2019t the cooler get colder than 46\u00b0F (8\u00b0C)? A: This cooler is designed for moderate cooling, not refrigeration. It maintains a lowest temperature of about 46\u00b0F (8\u00b0C), . It is ideal for herbs, medication, skincare, cosmetics, cigars, or other essentials that require a consistent, monitored temperature. Which is not cold enough for storing perishable food."
