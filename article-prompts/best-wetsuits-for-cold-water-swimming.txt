      "Why - Wetsuits can give you extra warmth in cold water.

You may feel constricted the first time wear it, but it\u2019s necessary to provide you with warmth and buoyancy.

You can instantly enjoy the smooth zipping process with the correct operation.",

The outermost layer is also made of nylon which will last longer than other materials.",
