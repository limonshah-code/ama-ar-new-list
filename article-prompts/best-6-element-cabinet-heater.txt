They take a little longer to warm a room, but do a much better job maintaining a desired temperature.",

With an overheat safety feature, the heater proactively shuts off if internal components approach a temperature that may lead to overheating or fire risk. To reset, turn off the heater, switch the master power switch off, unplug it, & allow a 20-minute cooldown."
