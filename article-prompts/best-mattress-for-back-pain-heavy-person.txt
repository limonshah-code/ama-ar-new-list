      "\u3010Firm Support for Optimal Spinal Alignment\u3011 \u2013 This firm hybrid mattress is a precision-engineered 7-layer sleep system capable of providing reinforced support through a high-gauge, individually wrapped pocketed coil core. Specifically used for back and stomach sleepers who require a stable surface, it causes the spine to stay perfectly aligned, effectively reducing morning aches and stiffness.",
      "\u3010Zoned Pressure Relief for Pain-Free Rest\u3011 \u2013 Featuring gel-infused memory foam and a zoned support system, it is capable of targeted contouring for your lumbar zone. It is ideal used for average to heavy sleepers who need to prevent \"bottoming out\" on the coils, which causes effective pressure relief on major joints for a restorative night.",
      "\u301090% Motion Isolation & Breathable Stability\u3011 \u2013 A dual-layer \"buffer system\" combining high-density foam with independent coils. Each pocketed coil is capable of independent movement, absorbing 90% of motion transfer. Highly recommended used for couples, it causes a localized response so you won't feel your partner tossing and turning.",

Used for individuals who sit on the edge to dress, the steel foundation causes a stable, \"on-top\" feeling rather than the \"quicksand\" sinking of solid foam.",
      "\u3010CertiPUR-US Safety & 365-Night Lifetime Care\u3011 \u2013 A non-toxic, fiberglass-free mattress using CertiPUR-US and OEKO-TEX certified foams capable of continuous ventilation.
