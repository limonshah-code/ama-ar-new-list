This allows the hose to soften and relax, preventing persistent curls. 2) Rotate the backup valve so the water flow points upward or downward, as side-facing jets can cause the hose to spin and tangle faster. 3) Add one or two extra float balls and shorten the distance between them for better hose management.",

The pool must have a dedicated water inlet with a 1.5-inch female thread to connect the Universal Wall Fitting. This unit is an ideal choice if you have an older pool already equipped with this specific setup. However, if your pool lacks this dedicated inlet, this cleaner may not be suitable, as installing a booster pump and new dedicated plumbing can be time-consuming and costly."
