      "POWER SAVING + WATER SAVING: The water system automatically enters power-saving standby mode when not in use to reduce power consumption. Filters are also designed to help save water with an impressive 2:1 Pure to Drain ratio. Leftover water from a cycle isn't deemed wastewater so more water is saved to use for various household purposes.",
      "FILTER LIFE MONITOR: The countertop water filters last for a long time between 12-24 months to provide 1-2 years of clean drinking water before needing replacement. Monitor display shows the service life of filters and water quality so you can easily keep track of filter replacement and periodically switch out filter tubes.",
