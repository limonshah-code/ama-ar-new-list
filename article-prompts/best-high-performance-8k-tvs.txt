      "UNLEASH THE FULL POTENTIAL OF YOUR APPLE TV \u2013 New Apple TV models have amazing capabilities including true-to-life picture and sound, High Frame Rate HDR for smooth fast-action sports, and Apple Arcade. However, a cheap HDMI cable will prevent the fast dataflow needed from your Apple TV to your television, resulting in a subpar viewing experience.",
      "IMPORTANCE OF DATAFLOW \u2013 Connecting a cheap HDMI cable to your Apple TV is like connecting a regular garden hose to a high-performance fire engine. Some water would exit the garden hose, but the capabilities of the high-performance fire engine would be severely limited. On the other hand, using a high-performance fire hose would enable the fire engine to spray far more water (just like a high-performance HDMI cable enables Apple TV to send far more data to your television).",
      "UP TO 2.6 TIMES FASTER \u2013 Apple TV is capable of sending huge dataflow to your television for a powerful viewing experience, but a cheap HDMI cable restricts the dataflow. In contrast, the TotalMount Cinema Grade HDMI cable enables up to 2.6 times faster dataflow than HDMI 2.0 cables.",
      "COMPATIBILITY \u2013 Compatible with all Apple TV generations. (This Cinema Grade cable meets or exceeds all HDMI 2.1 standards.)",
      "PERFORMANCE NOTE \u2013 Unlocking the full potential of your Apple TV requires not only a premium HDMI cable but also a strong internet connection and a high-resolution media source."
