Wetsuit works by trapping a thin layer of water between the neoprene and your skin so you are going to get wet(hence the name, wetsuit). The water between the skin and the wetsuit will form a thermal isolation layer, which will prevent the heat generated from your body spreading out, that keeps you warm.",

The outermost layer is also made of nylon which will last longer than other materials.",
