      "ECZEMA \"IT\" BALM: Tallow is rich in vitamins A,D,E,K and B1 and plentiful fatty acids; while our herb-infused olive oil is high in polyphenols and antioxidants. This yields a balm that is nourishing to your skin and provides a protective barrier that's better than petroleum products as it is both breathable and absorbable. For people who want real results for their eczema, psoriasis, or dry skin, this is your \"it\" product.",
      "SOURCING: We source our tallow from USA small farmers who practice regenerative agriculture. This means that they rotationally graze their cows all year long, never feeding anything other than grass. These healthy, happy cows create a beautiful, golden yellow fat that contains high levels of vitamins and minerals. Our suet is hand-rendered by our skilled team before it is scent-approved and then used in our tallow formula, crafted by hand in small batches.",
      "MILD, CLEAN AROMA: Some tallow balms out there stink like the dickens. We are proud to offer a tallow that smells only lightly buttery upon opening--not beefy or off-putting. Enjoy clean, natural skincare without smelling like a steak (if that's not what you were looking for...).",
      "ABOUT OUR PROCESS: At Hearth and Homestead, we are a small, family-owned business that holds to high standards for every single ingredient we put in our products. We use only high quality essential oils, butters, fats, herbs, and spices. We never use artificial ingredients like micas, dyes, or artificial fragrances."
