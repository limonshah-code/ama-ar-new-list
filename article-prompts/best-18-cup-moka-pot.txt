Generally in 3-5 minutes to complete the liquid, when you hear the obvious out of gas sound, that is, the extraction has been completed, at this time should immediately remove the moka pot from the heat source, to avoid dry burning caused by the bottom of the pot is damaged",
      "Warm Tip 2: The number of cups on our product page does not refer to the specific number of cups that can be directly produced by the moka pot, but is based on the industry standard capacity reference. The actual amount of coffee produced may vary depending on factors such as the amount of water added, coffee powder, personal taste preferences, and cup size, and will usually be slightly lower than the number of cups shown.Therefore 2 Cup/3 Cup/4 Cup would be too small, so we recommend that you purchase 6 Cup/9 Cup/12 Cup/14 Cup"
