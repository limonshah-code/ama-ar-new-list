      "\u3010Thickened pipes,No Bursts\u3011 - MIXC soaker hose is twice as thick as regular ones (1mm vs. 0.5mm), so it\u2019s way stronger and won\u2019t blow up even with high water pressure. Even if you drag it on rocky mountain trails, it won\u2019t leak or crack. The material is sunproof too \u2013 it won\u2019t melt or get brittle after sitting in the hot sun like cheaper hoses do.",
      "\u3010Copper Joints,No Leaks\u3011 - Unlike cheap plastic joints that crack, rust, or leak over time, the MIXC upgraded seepage pipe uses strong aluminum rings to lock thickened pipes onto solid copper joints. This design makes the pipe and joints stick together tightly so water won\u2019t leak from the connections when pressure builds up. The copper parts are also super tough \u2013 they won\u2019t get damaged by weather, sun, or rough handling, which means they last way longer than regular plastic ones. Together, the thick pipes and copper joints fix the leaks and breakage most hoses struggle with.",
      "\u3010Long Swivel Handle,Better Use\u3011 - Unlike short handles that feel awkward, our upgraded connector has a longer grip designed to fit your hand better. The 360\u00b0 swivel (that spins freely like a wheel) makes twisting motions smooth, so hoses won\u2019t twist or knot up during use \u2013 perfect for gardens, patios, or tight corners.",
      "\u3010Usage suggestions\u3011 - Gardening experts with 10+ years of experience say: Because of the pipe\u2019s built-in holes, water flows slower at the end \u2013 that\u2019s why we suggest connecting no more than 50ft at once. Keep water pressure between 40-60psi and always add the included washers before use. These simple steps protect your pipes and keep them working great, even after years of heavy use.",
      "\u3010After-sales service\u3011 - We have fully upgraded the product to provide you with professional services and high-quality user experience. You can contact us at any time for any problems you encounter during use, and we will definitely deal with it as soon as possible"
