      "[5-Stage Filtration] - The Survimate water filter bottle utilizes advanced composite filter technology to effectively reduce a wide range of contaminants. The filter has passed authoritative NSF/ANSI 42 certification, it employs a coarse filter screen, a 0.01\u03bcm hollow fiber UF membrane, a sediment PP membrane, purification beads, and activated carbon fiber to reduce chlorine, unpleasant odors, heavy metals, sediment, soil, organic matter, and other impurities.",
      "[Smaller Filter Pore Size] - Featuring a 0.01-micron hollow fiber UF membrane, the filter removes 99.99% of harmful substances from water, surpassing the 0.2-micron pore size typically found in other brands. The smaller pore size ensures higher filtration precision, delivering cleaner and safer drinking water.",
      "[Built-in Compass] - Perfect for camping and outdoor exploration, the water bottle is equipped with a built-in compass on its top, helping you navigate and stay oriented during your adventures.",
      "[Long Lifespan] - The durable filter element can purify up to 1,500L (396 gallons) of drinking water, replacing approximately 3,000 single-use plastic bottles (500ml). Proper care and maintenance can extend its lifespan. For optimal performance, it is recommended to replace the filter after filtering 1,500L of water. Note: This water bottle is not dishwasher-safe.",
      "[Usage Tips] - When using the bottle for the first time, the initial water may carry some carbon particles and appear slightly black. This is normal and safe. To ensure clean drinking water, sip through the straw and spit out the first few mouthfuls of filtered water. Please note, it may require more suction than standard bottles due to its 5-layer filtration system. Avoid blocking the silicone air hole next to the straw, as airflow is essential for proper water suction."
