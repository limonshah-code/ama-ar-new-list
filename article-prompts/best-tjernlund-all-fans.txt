      "Reduces Drying Times: The Tjernlund M-4DBT is designed specifically to reduce drying times by enhancing the exhaust airflow of your dryer. If your home has a dryer duct that runs longer than 25 feet or has multiple bends, you may experience sluggish drying due to weak exhaust performance.

The fan turns on and off in sync with your dryer based on pressure, requiring no manual intervention. In addition, it includes a post-purge setting, which keeps the fan running for a few minutes after the dryer cycle finishes. This ensures that any residual lint is completely cleared from the ductwork, preparing the system for the next load.",

The M-4DBT will fit seamlessly into your laundry setup, improving its performance instantly.",
      "Energy Efficiency and Safety: The M-4DBT doesn\u2019t just save you time\u2014it also helps you save on energy costs.
