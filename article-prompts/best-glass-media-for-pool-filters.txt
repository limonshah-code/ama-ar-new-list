      "SUSTAINABLE: Clean Bite Glass is made from 100% post-consumer recycled glass, which has been crushed down to the consistency of sand.",
      "EFFECTIVE FILTRATION: The irregular shape of the Clean Bite granules lock together better and sit closer, with more surface area than sand. This prevents channeling inside the filter, washing out or spinning around, thereby capturing more debris. With the ability to filter down to 2-5 microns, Clean Bite Glass can capture more contaminants.",
      "LONGEVITY: Because glass is non-porous, it is less prone to become gunky and requires replacement far less often.",
      "PURIFYING: Another attribute that makes glass unique in your pool filter is its inherent slight negative charge, which also enables it to capture metals in the water like iron and magnesium.",
      "IMPROVED CLARITY: Glass is a cleaner product overall than sand for your filter. It is not mined and therefore has far less dust and residue and has a longer life in your filter than other media. You can feel better about the quality of the crystal clear water of your pool using glass because not only is this 100% recycled, but it doesn\u2019t contain anything hazardous such as crystalline silica like some sands, and disposal requires no special consideration."
