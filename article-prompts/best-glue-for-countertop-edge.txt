For the best results, use an edgebanding machine for consistent glue application; industrial-sized/smaller machines and manual are also viable. Tips for Application (1) Apply appropriate temperature (2) Adjust speed for good flow and correct open time for strong bond. (3) Apply even pressure to the entire edgebanding width to avoid gaps and bubbles. (4) Use of enough glue to cover all areas for secure bond."
