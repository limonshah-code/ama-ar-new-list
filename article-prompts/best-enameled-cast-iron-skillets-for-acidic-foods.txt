A particulate of glass, called frit, is applied to the cast iron vessel and then baked at temperatures between 1200 and 1400\u00b0 F. The glass frit melts and fuses to the cast iron, forming a bond. Porcelain enamel on cast iron is heat tolerant and impervious to water and other consumables.",

Although enameled cast iron is dishwasher safe, hand washing with warm soapy water and a nylon scrub brush is recommended to keep your Casserole in tip top shape.",

The tightly fitting lid seals in moisture for scrumptious pot roast, stews or a large batch of beans. Our heat retention also reduces the amount of energy needed for cooking.",
