      "Please note - This whole house water filter is installed at the main water supply line in order to treat all the water in your home. Unlike an RO system, this whole house water filtration system will NOT reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and instead keeps healthy minerals in your water; if you are interested in a filter that removes TDS consider our iSpring Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems. The polyphosphate filter does not remove calcium and magnesium from water - it only prevents those molecules from forming scale."
