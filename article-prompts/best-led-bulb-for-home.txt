      "[Bright & Efficient] Compared with other LED bulbs, SANSI's highly efficient light bulbs can provide 1600 lumens using only 12 watts of power, equivalent to 100W incandescent bulbs. Based on 3 hours per day usage, save up to 95% electricity. (Notice: SANSI A15 LED light bulb is in diameter (2.13 inch) larger than standard A15 size bulbs. Please check if the bulb size fits your light fixture before making a purchase.)",
      "[Flicker-Free] Adopting high light transmission optical lenses, up to 42 LED chips can not only provide you and your family with the light source they need daily but also provide a healthy living or work environment. No flickering, no noise.",
      "[Chip on Ceramic Technology] SANSI's ceramic technology replaces the traditional Mcpcb aluminum substrate with a non-conductive ceramic heat sink, directly soldering the LED chip on the ceramic heat sink, effectively reducing the systematic thermal resistance between the LED PN junction and the surface of the heat sink, resulting in faster heat conduction and higher product reliability, making SANSI's bulbs perform with higher light efficiency.",
      "[Safe and Reliable] The lamp body is made of special ceramic material, and the flame retardant grade reaches grade V0. The reinforced insulation structure means no risk of electric shock, its safer. The whole shell material reaches the WF2 anti-corrosion grade, which is more reliable. The hollow design is good for heat dissipation. (Notice: Because of better heat dissipation of the ceramic chip the temperature radiates quickly. So the surface of the light bulb is hot. Please don't touch it by your hands directly! No worries about the safety of the light bulb. Our chip uses temperature adaptive packaging which helps enlarge the service time of the light bulb.)",
      "[Guarantees] California Energy Efficiency CEC Certification, quality and safety verified, 22.5 years LED bulb lifespan, 5 years service assistance."
