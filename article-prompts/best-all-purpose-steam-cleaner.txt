The Pressurized steam cleaner is equipped with a long power cord and steam hose, enabling you to easily clean from a distance.",
      "Tips: If you've received our handheld steam cleaner and found the temperature unsatisfactory, don't worry! Our steam cleaner has a unique feature. The nearer the nozzle is to the item being cleaned, the hotter the steam gets. The high-temperature area is just around the nozzle. So, when using it, keep the steam gun close to the surface. It's not designed for distant high-heat cleaning. Follow this tip, and you'll enjoy great cleaning performance and the right temperature."
