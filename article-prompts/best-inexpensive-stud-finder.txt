    "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FRI5TMY?tag=lawnblog-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1",

      "ACTUAL REVIEW: \"If you have very thick plaster walls, this thing is the BEST. I've tried everything from strong magnets to a stud buddy, and my issue has always been that the plaster on my walls is so thick I can't feel the magnet sticking. The studpop gives you a visual when metal is found, unlike the others I mentioned, and that has been a GAME CHANGER. I still can barely feel the magnetic pull when the studpop finds a nail, but it pops up just like it advertises and it is in fact a stud. This is a great little tool and I was skeptical because the magnet didn't seem as strong as some of the other magnets I've used, but the visual cue is what really makes this one great. Highly recommend.\"",
      "MORE POWERFUL THAN THE COMPETITION: The StudPoP's unique design makes it much more SENSITIVE than ALL other magnetic stud finders, making it ideal for ANY construction type, including challenging surfaces like LATH & PLASTER and TILE.",
      "DON'T BE FOOLED: All other magnetic stud finders only work on SHEETROCK. But the StudPoP will work on SHEETROCK, LATH, PLASTER and TILE!",
      "FORGET ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC ONES: They depend on unreliable batteries and a clumsy calibration procedure and they almost NEVER work on LATH & PLASTER. Bottom line: SAVE YOUR MONEY because most of them aren't very good at anything :(",
      "FUN & EASY TO USE: The StudPoP makes stud finding FUN with its 1\" diameter moving magnet that gives an audible click and a visual movement when a fastener is found. It doesn't get any easier than this!",
      "PERFERRED BY OWNERS OF OLDER HOMES: Because of the way walls were done in the \"olden days\", the StudPoP is the go-to stud finder for folks with those IMPOSSIBLE walls.",
      "MORE REVIEWS: \"Finally, a stud finder that works on my lath-and-plaster walls built in 1950! The Z* and C* didn't work worth a damn, but this little $11 StudPop found nails on 3 separate studs in less than 5 minutes. Interestingly, I didn't even start my search as one logically would from an outlet; I just randomly started searching in the middle of a wall and I didn't assume my studs are evenly spaced, as it turns out they're not.) I then tested it on a different wall that has shelves hung on L brackets, and it reliably indicated nails vertically under each bracket. I can't wait to hang my TVs and cabinets with the help of this handy little gadget!\"",
      "\"This is an amazingly effective, fantastic tool. I had no idea how effective these were. My expensive stud detector is mediocre to poor for most purposes. This simple magnetic tool pops up firmly over every dry wall screw. Use it to find each screw and easily map out where the studs are. Worth every penny. Saves time and frustration.\""
