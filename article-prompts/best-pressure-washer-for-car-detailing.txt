      "Note 01: Regarding the water inside the pressure washer - This is actually a normal occurrence for all pressure washers on the market. Before shipping, every unit undergoes a mandatory pump test to ensure its functionality (e.g., checking for leaks and proper water flow). A small amount of residual water from this test is unavoidable, and it does not mean the product has been used.",
      "Note 02: Regarding water source connection for the pressure washer - As this unit is designed to be portable, it does not come with an adapter for connecting to household faucets. Therefore, it cannot be linked to a household faucet to draw water."
