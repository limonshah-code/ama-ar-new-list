However, we discovered that this is quite beneficial to use with our other square shaft tools as it helps keep the tool flat and the cutter at the lathe center line and greatly reduces \"teeter tottering\" that can be common from a standard tool rest. We also like to use this with the Simple Parting Tool as the tool body can be on the flat tool rest, which greatly helps keep the tool steady and the tip at the center line."
