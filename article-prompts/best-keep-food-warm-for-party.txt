A: The h\u00b0eats pad does generate heat, but it\u2019s designed to work with the natural heat of hot food for maximum efficiency. As the food begins to cool, the pad\u2019s mineral gel absorbs that heat, activating a thermal exchange that releases stored energy gradually.

It\u2019s safer, disposable, and easy to use, making it ideal for catering, food delivery, and off-site events\u2014without the mess or fire risk."
