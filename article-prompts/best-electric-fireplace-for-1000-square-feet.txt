So we have improved the defects in this design on this product. And our product also has the function of automatic power outage. If the buyer accidentally knocks down the fireplace during use, the fireplace will automatically cut off the power. This greatly improves the security of use.",

Our products have five wind speeds and brightness for buyers to choose from. When buyers are ready to go to bed, buyers can choose the lowest wind speed and the darkest brightness. This will not affect the buyer's sleep quality, but also help the buyer get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom.And our products have a timing, so set the closing time before the buyer goes out, which can not only save resources, but also allow the buyer to still have a warm room after returning home."
