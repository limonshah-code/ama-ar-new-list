      "Ceramic rotating shaft, wear-resistant, rust-free, long service life \u203a See more product details Report an issue with this product or seller Note: if floating objects in the water block the bottom inlet of the pump, resulting in a decrease in the water volume and width of the fountain, it must be pulled back with a traction rope and cleaned up. Only then can it be restored. Water bodies with severe floating debris and algae are not suitable for use.",
      "To achieve the perfect effect, it is recommended to tie a floating ball one meter away from the power cord. High quality power cords are very heavy and can affect the balance of the fountain pump. Severely polluted water bodies can easily lead to blockage of the inlet, reduction of water volume, and changes in the height and width of the fountain, and should be promptly pulled back and removed."
