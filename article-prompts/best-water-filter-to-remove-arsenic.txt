      "3-Stage Filtration - Purewell gravity water filter system adopts a composite filter technology, can effectively minimize a broad array of contaminants. The black carbon filter utilizes a 0.01\u03bcm hollow fiber UF membrane, a silver ion membrane, and an activated carbon block designed to reduce chlorine and intercept rust, sediment, organic matter and heavy metals.",
      "Precision Filtration with Smaller Pore Size - Boasting a filter pore size of just 0.01 microns, the Purewell gravity water filter efficiently sieves out 99.99% of minuscule materials from the water, while other brands offer only a 0.2 microns filter pore size. Smaller filter pore size equates to enhanced filtration accuracy. Impressively, despite this microscopic pore size, the Purewell water filter system retains an optimal flow rate of 4 gallons per hour.",
      "Energy Efficient - Operating on the principle of gravity filtration, this system requires no electricity. The Purewell gravity water filter system comprises upper and lower chambers: the former for unfiltered tap water and the latter for collecting filtered water. Its no-electricity requirement makes it versatile for both indoor and outdoor use. NOTE: Avoid adding tap water to the top chamber when the bottom chamber is filled with filtered water to prevent leakage.",
      "Durable and Replaceable - The pair of black carbon filters provides up to 6000 gallons of drinkable water, with each filter element serving up to 3000 gallons (lifespan may vary depending on water quality). For optimal performance, it's recommended to replace the filter elements every 6 months. Please note: This system does NOT lower the TDS value."
