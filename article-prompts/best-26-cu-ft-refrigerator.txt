Beer Mode maintains a colder 26\u00b0F finish for beer, delivering a crisp frost edge without freezing the can.

This IPX4 waterproof and ETL certified system is engineered to operate across a wide outdoor temperature range, supporting consistent interior conditions from extreme cold to peak summer heat.",

Support is provided directly through our official Amazon service channel by a team familiar with the product by design, ensuring continuity from purchase through everyday use.
