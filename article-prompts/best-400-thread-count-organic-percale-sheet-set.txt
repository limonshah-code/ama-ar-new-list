      "SUSTAINABLE CERTIFIED ORGANIC COTTON: GOTS Organic cotton is produced using 100% natural seeds so there is no use of harmful chemicals. Traditional cotton is grown on the same soil repeatedly which deteriorates the soil quality, removes all-natural nutrients and leads to an unhealthy crop harvest. Organic cotton is rotated from one soil to another, so the natural nutrients retain water for long which means that the land requires less irrigation & produces sustainable sheets sets.",
