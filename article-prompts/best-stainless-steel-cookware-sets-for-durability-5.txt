Clean with dish detergent and a sponge or soft mesh scrubber. To maintain luster, polish with water and a mild acid, like vinegar or lemon juice. Dishwasher safe, but to maintain the visibility of interior measurement lines, handwashing is best. Stainless steel requires no special handling, unlike cast iron, pure copperware, enameled and nonstick clad cookware.",

No need to worry about health risks when cooking at high heat, like with traditional cheap non stick coating. There's also no need to painstakingly craft your own coating and baby it, like with cast iron. Just cook, clean, and put it away. Heavy duty quality, with lightweight construction."
