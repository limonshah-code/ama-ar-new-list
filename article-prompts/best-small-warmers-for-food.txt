A: The h\u00b0eats pad does generate heat, but it\u2019s designed to work with the natural heat of hot food for maximum efficiency. As the food begins to cool, the pad\u2019s mineral gel absorbs that heat, activating a thermal exchange that releases stored energy gradually. This process helps maintain serving temperature for up to 2 hours. If the pad starts cold, it takes more energy to activate, so pairing it with hot food ensures optimal performance.",

A: The h\u00b0eats Food Warming Pad works perfectly with any hot or warm dish, including catered meals, buffet trays, casseroles, and even takeaway orders.

      "Q: How long will the h\u00b0eats pad keep food warm? A: Each h\u00b0eats pad is designed to hold food at a safe serving temperature for approximately 2 hours. This makes it ideal for catering events, buffets, and any scenario where consistent food temperature is critical.",

The h\u00b0eats pad is a flameless, water-activated alternative to gel alcohol cans and other open-flame methods. It\u2019s safer, disposable, and easy to use, making it ideal for catering, food delivery, and off-site events\u2014without the mess or fire risk."
