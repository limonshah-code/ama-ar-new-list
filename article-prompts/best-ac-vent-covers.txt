The important measurement is the interior duct opening size. Example: A traditional vent cover size can have a face size of 14x8, and neck of a little less than a 12x6. Your air duct opening should measure 12x6, so you purchase a 12x6. Vent cover dimensions are categorized by the neck and not by the face of the air vent cover.",
