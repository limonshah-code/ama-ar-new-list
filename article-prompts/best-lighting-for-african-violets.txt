      "About African Violets. African violets (Saintpaulia ionantha) are small, perennial, evergreen flowering plants with thick, hairy leaves. Their leaves have long petioles (leaf stems) and are arranged in a basal cluster at the base of the plant. The violet-like flowers are bilaterally symmetric with five petals and can be in various colors. African violets can live up to 50 years.",
      "Why Grow African Violets. Because of their vibrant flower colors and long-lasting flowers, African violets are favorable plants for many American families. The plants are easy to grow and can bloom multiple times a year if cared for properly. They can grow well in most home and office environments and are a fun, inexpensive way to dress up any windowsill, desktop, office hallway and for various events and arrangements.",
      "Care Tips. African violets require well-drained soil. Bright indirect light is a key for African violets\u2019 health and blooming. Avoid direct sunlight. Water your plant when the soil surface becomes dry. The plants should be carefully side watered or by soaking to avoid water on the foliage which may cause leaf spotting. Feed your plants with an African violet fertilizer biweekly. Pinch or deadhead spent flowers to save energy for buds/blooms and foliage."
