      "MULTI-SURFACE SPRAY| Use our dust mite remover spray on a variety of surfaces including mattresses & pillows, fabrics, furniture, upholstery, hard surfaces, and pet beds when directions are followed. Colorless & odorless, the solution will not leave residue behind but always test for colorfastness before use- **NOT FOR USE ON CARPETS**",

Dustmite X (EPA #67419-1) has gone through extensive testing to show it is effective when the directions for use are followed. Once removed, one can then treat residual dust mite waste allergens with our Allergy Solution to maintain an allergy free home."
