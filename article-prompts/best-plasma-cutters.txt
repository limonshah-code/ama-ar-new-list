      "[NON-HF BLOWBACK PILOT ARC] This plasma cutter machine uses non-high-frequency blowback start, eliminating the electromagnetic interference commonly found in traditional HF machines. The pilot arc allows you to cut without touching the metal, ideal for rusty or painted surfaces. Delivers up to 55A (240V) for smooth cuts through steel, stainless steel, copper, and more\u2014up to 1 inch (26mm) thick. Ensures smooth and clean edges for professional-grade results. (Cutting Range: 120V: 12\u201315mm | 240V: 18\u201326mm)",
      "[SMART APP CONTROL] Built-in APP connectivity allows you to control and monitor your CUT55 MP remotely via your smartphone. You can adjust cutting current, monitor air pressure, receive error alerts, and even track work status in real time. With APP control, you can increase efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve operational safety.",
      "[MULTI-FUNCTION CUTTING] Supports expanded metal, rust removal, and plasma gouging functions. Expanded metal ensures continuous cutting on mesh or perforated materials. Rust removal enables non-contact cleaning of corrosion or coatings. Plasma gouging levels surfaces and strips paint, ideal for repair and fabrication. (Note: Replace the nozzle when using plasma gouging.)",
      "[REAL-TIME AIR PRESSURE DETECTION] Equipped with a digital air pressure monitoring system that continuously checks incoming air pressure and displays it in real time on the upgraded LED panel. If pressure goes out of optimal range, the system sounds an alert to help prevent undercutting, arc instability, or torch damage, ensuring consistent cuts and longer consumable life. [Recommended pressure: 0.3\u20130.55 MPa or 0.4 MPa (57.5 PSI)]",
      "[FLEXIBLE TRIGGER OPTIONS] Offers versatile trigger and operation modes including PA (Pilot Arc), PT (Post Time), 2T (press-and-hold), and 4T (press-to-start/press-to-stop), allowing easy switching between settings for different cutting needs from quick tasks to long runs.",
      "[FULL SAFETY PROTECTION SYSTEM] Built-in protections include over-voltage, over-current, overload, overheating, high and low air pressure. The machine detects and reacts to faults automatically to prevent damage or accidents. Internal alarms and automatic shutdowns ensure user safety and extend machine lifespan, providing peace of mind for pros and DIYers."

The Maximum cutting thickness is recommended to 12mm@35A 110V 50PSI; 20mm@60A 220V 65PSI. Dry and compressed air is required. Power breaker up to 40A@110V 35A; Up to 30A@220V 60A.",
      "[Pilot Arc]: bestarc plasma cutter with the pilot arc function. It is a high-frequency non-touch arc starting mode. The torch head does not need to touch the metal plate, making it effective on rusted, painted, or dirty metal surfaces. Adjustable PA function for extended pilot arc duration, reduced energy consumption in non-cutting work, reduced electrode burning, and extended consumables cutting life.",
      "[Air Sensor Technology]: The air sensor built in machine displays air pressure on front panel of the machine. Users can adjust the air pressure manually through the air regulator (air pressure cannot be automatically adjusted). Air filter is installed in the machine, equipped with a quick-connect 1/4 NPT air connector, ready for use right out of the box. Once connected to an air compressor, the recommended air pressure should be within 65 PSI, with a flow rate of 250 liters per minute. Note: The compressor needs to be purchased separately.",
      "[LED Screen Display]: The screen centrally displays parameters such as air pressure, voltage, and current, allowing users to understand the equipment status in real-time and adjust operations in a timely manner, improving operational efficiency. If the plasma cutter cannot work, the screen comes with an error code, making it easy to find out the problems.",
      "[2T/4T/PA/PT Function]: Post time adjustable from 3\u201315s to cool the torch. Adjust the cooling time of the torch head to extend the service life of consumables. We recommend a cooling time of 4-8 seconds. The PA function allows pilot arc timing adjustment up to 15s; longer times are ideal for mesh cutting, shorter times help extend consumable life. 2T/4T automatic cutting release your finger.2T is a semi-automatic cutting control, and 4T is an automatic cutting control."
