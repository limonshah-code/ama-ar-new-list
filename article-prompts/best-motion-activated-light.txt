For optimal results, ensure the sensor faces downward and is completely unobstructed (not compatible with enclosed, upside-down, or frosted fixtures). If the sensing range appears shorter than expected, it may be due to partial blockage or fixture design limitations. Need help? Contact us before ordering, we're happy to assist!",
