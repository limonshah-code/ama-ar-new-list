      "2 IN 1 INDUCTION COOKTOP & GRIDDLE GRILL : 1800W portable induction cooktop 2 burner with cast iron grill can be used either as a replacement for electric indoor grills or as a stand-alone induction burner. This electric grill is perfect for frying pancakes, sausages, steaks and eggs without sticking to the grill pan. It heats up quickly and evenly over the entire iron grill in just a few minutes.",
      "MULTI-FUNCTIONAL TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Unlike electric grill pans with built-in cord, which have a huge temperature difference between the middle and the edges. The double-chip induction cooktop provides stable and even heating. Separate left and right controls allow frying and serving at the same time, with 9 power and 5 temperature controls to meet to different ingredients needs.",
      "SMOKELESS CAST IRON GRILL PAN: The cast iron grill provides excellent heat retention and distribution, with four temperature control points on the bottom for precise heat distribution and even heating, reducing smoke by 95% and providing a healthy dining environment. Note: After use, please wait for the grill pan to cool down before touching it to prevent burns.",
      "CLEANING IS SO CONVENIENT: The induction cooktop and grill plate can be separated and the induction burner has a high quality smooth glass surface that can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth. The smooth surface of the all cast iron grill pan is covered with a non-toxic, non-stick coating that leaves no frying residue.",
      "INTELLIGENT SAFETY DESIGN: When both burners are working by power setting mode at the same time, the maximum power will not exceed 1800W total. Child lock included, 9 power levels quickly choose your desired power from 400W to 1100W in 100W increments, 5 temperature levels from 248 \u00b0F to 410 \u00b0F in 36 \u00b0F increments.
