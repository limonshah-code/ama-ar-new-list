      "Sturdy and durable: Permeable resin jointing sand is designed for Joints in Pavers, Tiles & Natural Stone. It is packaged in sealed bags and can be activated and cured when exposed to air to form a durable and sturdy path. Its convenient use method is ideal for professionals and DIY enthusiasts",
      "High load-bearing capacity: Resin jointing sand for filling joints is made from natural fine sand, resulting in a smooth and even surface after application. It has extremely high compressive strength, remaining stable even under high water pressure, and effectively inhibits weed growth. It is also frost-resistant and helps control rainwater and surface runoff, making it an ideal material for creating garden pathway",
      "No cracking: For exposed aggregate pavers, use grout joints with a minimum width of 1/8 inch and a minimum depth of 3/4 inch. Suitable for use over permeable base layers or open-graded aggregate; do not install directly on soil, crushed stone, or any other substrate with poor drainage. The pavers must also be properly laid and secured with mortar to prevent movement and eliminate the risk of cracking",
      "High-quality materials: Hardscape resin sand is made from natural resin and natural fine sand. The fine sand is sourced from natural deposits, resulting in a hard, durable material with a natural aesthetic appeal. The resin used is also a natural resin, ensuring greater strength and durability. The resulting resin-bonded sand for joint filling is resistant to pressure and frost, and contains no harmful substances",
      "Easy to use: Resin sand is suitable for hard surfaces. It's also very easy to apply: simply dampen the surface of the joint, spread the product evenly on the surface, smooth it with a trowel, and allow it to cure for 24 hours. Vacuum-packed product can be stored for 8-10 months"
