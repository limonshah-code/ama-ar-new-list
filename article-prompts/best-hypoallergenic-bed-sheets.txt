      "HIGH GSM: With 145 grams per square meter (GSM), higher than most other sheets on the market, DOZ sheets are one of the most durable sheets on the market and still offer the ultimate softness and lightweight.",
      "BUTTERY SOFT: DOZ viscose sheets feature a sateen weave for an exceptionally soft, comfortable feel that drapes closely to your skin. Ideal for sensitive skin, the fabric reduces friction during sleep. With a 300 thread count, these sheets are smoother and softer than 1000 thread count cotton.",
      "COOLING: DOZ viscose sheets are the best for anyone who sleeps hot, sweats in their sleep, or resides in a relatively warm or humid location. The fabric is highly breathable and also has moisture-wicking properties to keep you dry and comfortable all night long.",
      "16 INCH DEEP POCKET: The fitted sheets have a pocket depth of 16 inches, which allows them to fit most mattresses on the market. Wash in a cold, gentle cycle, then tumble dry on low heat. Remove your bedding as soon as the drying cycle is finished to reduce wrinkling, and avoid using fabric softener or dryer balls to prevent premature pilling."
