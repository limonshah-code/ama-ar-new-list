      "PREMIUM MEDIUM ROAST COFFEE: We have carefully selected the beans in this blend to create the classic and ideal cold brew coffee. We have ground the beans to a course grind that is optimal for flavor extraction during the cold brew process. Steeping Roast Ridge Cold Brew 100% Arabica coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period of time delivers a brew without the bitterness or the acidic elements. The result is a very balanced and medium bodied iced coffee.",
      "AROMATIC AND SMOOTH COFFEE: After steeping Roast Ridge Cold Brew blend you will notice the remarkable smoothness of the brew. The cold steeping highlights the coffee's natural sweetness presenting flavor notes of dark chocolate.",
      "COARSE GROUND COFFEE: Roast Ridge Coffee is gluten free, mold free, allergen free, kosher certified and non GMO. Freshness and flavor preservation are critical when it comes to coffee. Whole Bean coffee that is ground at home just before brewing delivers a much higher quality brew. Grinding at home also allows you to control the grind, which allows you to control the flavor potential and adjust for the brewing method. To maximize freshness, store in an air tight container until you're ready to grind and brew.",
      "SINGLE BATCH SLOW ROASTED: At Roast Ridge Coffee Roasters we slowly roast single batches of premium coffee beans to highlight the unique characteristics of each bean, ensuring a rich, full-bodied flavor that awakens the senses. We precisely manage all variables, temperature, time and airflow for each blend and roast level so we achieve the peak flavor profile. Our variety of origins, blends & roast levels bring you the best coffee to brew, serve and savor the experience.",
      "HIGH ELEVATION 100% ARABICA: Roast Ridge hand-picked coffees are sustainably sourced from small farms located in 17 different countries at the elevation of 1200 meters to 1800 meters above sea level. At higher elevations the cooler temperatures slow the growth of the coffee cherries allowing them to mature more slowly while developing complex flavors and a bean that is more dense. Whether you enjoy organic or fairtrade beans, single origins, blends or flavored coffee, we have the perfect blend and roast for you.",
